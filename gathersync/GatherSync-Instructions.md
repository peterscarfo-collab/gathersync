## Important Tips

✅ **Always sync after making changes** - Your availability/RSVP won't be shared until you tap "Sync Now"

✅ **Sync regularly to see updates** - Other people's responses will appear when you sync

✅ **Keep Expo Go installed** - You'll need it to access GatherSync until we release the standalone app

✅ **Internet connection required** - Syncing requires an active internet connection

---

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Force close and reopen** - Swipe up from app switcher and reopen Expo Go
2. **Check your internet connection** - Sync requires WiFi or mobile data
3. **Contact Peter** - He's testing this app and wants your feedback!
