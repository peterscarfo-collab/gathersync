## For iOS Users (Temporary Testing Solution)

GatherSync doesn't have a standalone iOS app yet (requires TestFlight or App Store). However, **iOS users can test using Expo Go** - a free development app.

**Important:** This is a temporary testing solution. The full iOS app will be released later.

### Step 1: Install Expo Go

1. Open the **App Store** on your iPhone
2. Search for **"Expo Go"**
3. Tap **Get** to install (it's free)
4. Open Expo Go after installation

### Step 2: Open GatherSync in Expo Go

**Option A: Scan QR Code**
1. Ask the organizer for the GatherSync QR code
2. Open **Expo Go** app
3. Tap **Scan QR Code**
4. Point your camera at the QR code
5. GatherSync will open automatically

**Option B: Use Link**
1. Ask the organizer for the Expo link (starts with "exp://" or "exps://")
2. Open the link on your iPhone
3. It will automatically open in Expo Go
4. GatherSync will load

### Step 3: Start Using GatherSync

1. Wait for the app to load (first time may take 30 seconds)
2. You'll see the **Events** screen
3. Find the events you were invited to
4. Tap your name to RSVP

### Important Notes for iOS Testing

**Limitations:**
- You must keep Expo Go installed during testing
- GatherSync opens inside Expo Go (not as a standalone app)
- Data may reset if you close Expo Go completely
- Requires internet connection to load initially

**This is only for testing!** The full iOS app will be available later through the App Store.

**Troubleshooting:**
- **QR code won't scan:** Make sure you're using the camera inside Expo Go, not your phone's camera app
- **App won't load:** Check your internet connection and try again
- **Expo Go crashes:** Restart your phone and try again
- **Can't find events:** Pull down to refresh the Events screen
