## Opening (5 minutes)

### Welcome & Context

**Say:**

>
> Today I want to show you the concept and get your honest feedback on the features and user experience. This is a desktop preview version - the full mobile app is coming soon.
>
> I'm going to record this session so I can review your feedback later. Is everyone okay with that?"

**Wait for consent, then start recording.**

### Set Expectations

**Say:**
> "A few things to know:
> - This is a prototype, so some features are still being refined
> - I'll be showing the desktop version today via screen share
> - Focus on the overall concept and whether this would be useful for your groups
> - Please interrupt with questions anytime
> - There are no wrong answers - honest feedback helps me improve it"

## Demo Flow (20 minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "How many of you have struggled to find a date that works for everyone when planning group events?"
>
> **[Wait for responses]**
>
> "Exactly! That's the problem GatherSync solves. Instead of endless back-and-forth texts or emails, everyone marks their availability in one place, and the app shows you the best date automatically."

### Part 2: Event Types (3 minutes)

**Screen share the Events screen**

**Say:**
> "GatherSync supports two types of events:
>
> 1. **Flexible Events** - When you're trying to find the best date among multiple options. Like 'When should we have our next AI Guys meetup?'
>
> 2. **Fixed Events** - When the date is already set and you just need RSVPs. Like 'Board meeting on January 15th at 2 PM - who can make it?'"

**Click "+ Create Event"**

### Part 3: Creating a Flexible Event (5 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Let me show you how to create a flexible event. I'll create one for our group."

**Walk through:**
1. Enter event name: "AI Guys February Meetup"
2. Select "Flexible" event type
3. Select month: February
4. Select year: 2025

**Say:**
> "Now I'll add participants. There are three ways to do this:"

**Show all three methods:**
1. **Manual:** Type a name, click Add
2. **AI Import:** Paste a list of names (show example)
3. **Contacts:** (Explain this works on mobile to import from phone)

**Add 4-5 participants manually**

**Say:**
> "I can also add meeting details like venue, team leader, virtual meeting link, etc."

**Add some meeting details:**
- Team Leader: Your name
- Meeting Type: In-Person
- Venue: "Corner Cafe"

**Click "Create Event"**

### Part 4: Marking Availability (4 minutes)

**On the event detail screen:**

**Say:**
> "Now participants would open the app and mark which days they're available. Let me show you how that works."

**Click "Mark Your Availability"**

**Say:**
> "See this calendar? I just tap days I'm available. Green means available, gray means not available. I can tap the same day again to remove it."

**Mark several days available**

**Say:**
> "Notice these buttons at the top - 'Mark All Weekends Available' and 'Mark All Weekends Unavailable'. This is handy if you know weekends work best for you."

**Click "Save Availability"**

**Back on event detail:**

**Say:**
> "Now look at the calendar. It shows a heatmap - darker days mean more people are available. See the star icon? That's the best day - the day with the most people available. The numbers show exactly how many people can make each day."

### Part 5: Creating a Fixed Event (3 minutes)

**Go back to Events screen, click "+ Create Event"**

**Say:**
> "Now let me show you a fixed event - when the date is already decided."

**Walk through:**
1. Enter event name: "Board Meeting - January"
2. Select "Fixed" event type
3. **Enter date:** Type "2025-01-15" in the date field
4. **Enter time:** Type "14:00" in the time field

**Say:**
> "On mobile, these would be nice date and time pickers. On desktop, we type the date as YYYY-MM-DD and time as HH:MM in 24-hour format."

**Add participants and create event**

**On event detail:**

**Say:**
> "For fixed events, there's no calendar. Just simple RSVP buttons: Attending, Not Attending, or No Response. Much simpler when the date is already set."

**Click "Attending"**

**Say:**
> "See how the RSVP summary updates? As people respond, you can see at a glance who's coming."

### Part 6: Templates (2 minutes)

**Click the three-dot menu, select "Save as Template"**

**Say:**
> "If you have recurring events - like monthly breakfasts or quarterly board meetings - you can save them as templates. Then next month, you just create from template and all your participants and settings are already there."

**Show Templates screen**

### Part 7: Other Features (1 minute)

**Quickly mention:**
- "Text All Participants" button (for sending reminders)
- Edit meeting details
- Mark attendance (for tracking who actually showed up)
- Attendance history (for reports)

## Troubleshooting

**If something doesn't work during demo:**

**Stay calm and say:**
> "This is exactly why we do testing! Let me note that down as something to fix."

**Common issues:**

**Date/time not changing:**
- Make sure you're typing the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD for date, HH:MM for time)
- Click outside the input to trigger the save

**App looks broken:**
- Refresh the page
- Say: "This is a development version, the production app will be more stable"

**Participants ask about features not built yet:**
- "Great idea! That's on the roadmap for the next version"
- Write it down visibly so they know you're listening

## Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **This is a prototype** - Set expectations, don't oversell
2. **Your feedback matters** - Make them feel heard
3. **The problem is real** - Validate that group scheduling is hard
4. **The solution is simple** - Show how GatherSync makes it easy
5. **Mobile app coming soon** - Desktop is just for demo purposes
